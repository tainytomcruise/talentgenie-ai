    cd backend
    ```

2.  Create and activate a virtual environment:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # Windows
    venv\Scripts\activate
    # Mac/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  Configure Environment Variables:
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend/` directory:
